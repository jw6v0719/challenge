# challenge
This challenge relys on regular expression to clean and extract the dimensions. 
The better way to keep these transformed data is set it in key-value database or data structure store such as Redis.
This implementation is simply show my idea of my approches. 
I would apply java fork/join or spark if the performance can't reach the requirement 
Some of the data contains ambiguous dimension information, the program will skipt these raws
Please add the csv file to resources/static folder if you would like to do local test.
Thanks.
